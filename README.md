# web_scraping_challenge
Module 11 Challenge

This assignment consists of two parts:
1. Mars News
2. Mars Weather

Mars News:
In the Mars News notebook ('part_1_mars_news.ipynb'), we will use automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup to scrape the headings and article previews of various news articles related to the planet Mars. We will store the various news articles headings and article previews in dictionary form in the 'part_1_mars_news.ipynb' notebook. Also, in order to ease the sharing of data with others, we will export the data to a JSON file ('mars_news.json').
Both the .ipynb and .json files previously referred to can be found in the GitHub repository titled 'web_scraping_challenge'.

Mars Weather:
In the Mars Weather notebook ('part_2_mars_weather.ipynb') we will scrape weather-related data about the planet Mars using Beautiful Soup and assemble the data into a Pandas Dataframe in order to allow analysis of the data.
In order to effectively analyse the data, we will convert the data to appropriate datatypes and then undertake to answer a range questions regarding the weather and celestial movements of the planet Mars.
The outputs from this analysis will be dispayed in the aforementioned .ipynb noteboook and will also be exported to a CSV file ('mars_data.csv'). Bot the .ipynb and .csv files previously referred to can be found in the GitHub repository titled 'web_scraping_challenge'.
